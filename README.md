# surfs_up

## Overview
I will be finding a few key aspects of Oahu’s seasonal weather data. The investors want to ensure I’ve hit all of the key points before opening the surf shop. These key aspects are finding statistical data about the month of June and December over the past few years. This is the "seasonal imformation" that was absent from the previous report.

## Resources
- Data Sources: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Jupyter Notebooks, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SQLAclchemy, SQ Lite, Flask, Visual Code Studio

## Findings
I found that the temperatures are as follows (max, min, average):
  - June '17 > 71, 83, 77.2
  - June '16 > 64, 81, 75.2
  - June '15 > 66, 81, 75
  - December '17 > N/A (information was unavaible)
  - December '16 > 60, 78, 71.1
  - December '15 > 65, 82, 73.4
  
The rainfall amounts are as follows (average):
  - June '17 > 0.12
  - June '16 > 0.21
  - June '15 > 0.12
  - December '17 > N/A (information was unavaible)
  - December '16 > 0.2
  - December '15 > 0.16
  
## Conclusion
I have detemined, by onlying looking at these two months, June and Decemeber, for the last few years, the temperature and rainfall does not vary much, and is very closely related. The sales for the surf and ice cream shop should very consistant very month by looking at the climate data.

But, for further analysis, I would like to go back at least 5 years, and look at EVERY month, to have more accurate numbers for the climate to help make a better informed decision about the surf shop.
