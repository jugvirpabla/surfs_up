## Overview
I will be finding a few key aspects of Oahu’s seasonal weather data. The investors want to ensure I’ve hit all of the key points before opening the surf shop. These key aspects are finding statistical data about the month of June and December over the past few years. This is the "seasonal information" that was absent from the previous report.

## Resources
- Data Sources: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Jupyter Notebooks, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SQLAclchemy, SQ Lite, Flask, Visual Code Studio

## Findings
I found that the temperatures are as follows (max, min, average) in Fahrenheit:
  - June '17 > 71, 83, 77.2
  - June '16 > 64, 81, 75.2
  - June '15 > 66, 81, 75
  - December '17 > N/A (information was unavailable
  - December '16 > 60, 78, 71.1
  - December '15 > 65, 82, 73.4
  
The rainfall amounts are as follows (average) in inches:
  - June '17 > 0.12
  - June '16 > 0.21
  - June '15 > 0.12
  - December '17 > N/A (information was unavailable)
  - December '16 > 0.2
  - December '15 > 0.16
  
## Conclusion
I have determined, by only looking at these two months, June and December, for the last few years, the temperature and rainfall does not very much, and is very closely related. The sales for the surf and ice cream shop should very consistent very month by looking at the climate data.

But, for further analysis, I would like to go back at least 5 years, and look at EVERY month, to have more accurate numbers for the climate to help make a better-informed decision about the surf shop. One final aspect I would want to look into is what is around the surf that we are trying open. Such as other surf or ice cream shops. if there are others around the shop, that will affect business and overall revenue.
